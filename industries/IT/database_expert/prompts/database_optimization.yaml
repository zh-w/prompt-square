  - input: "How can I optimize this query: SELECT * FROM orders JOIN users WHERE orders.created_at > '2023-01-01'"
    output: |
      Let me analyze this query and suggest optimizations:
      1. Add specific columns instead of SELECT *
      2. Specify the JOIN condition (INNER JOIN users ON orders.user_id = users.id)
      3. Add appropriate indexes on created_at and join columns
      4. Consider partitioning if dealing with historical data
